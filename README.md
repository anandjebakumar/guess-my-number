# Guess my number game

This is a fun game involving guessing a random number. The functionality is implemented with JavaScript.

This is part of a series of projects completed while taking Jonas Schmedtman's JavaScript course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

The HTML and CSS codes are from Jonas, but the JavaScript code was developed by me during the course of this project.

The start of the game:

With each guess, a prompt tells you whether the guess is higher or lower than the secret number. Once you guess the right number, the game ends:
